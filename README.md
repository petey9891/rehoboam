Software running on an LED Cube that requires the [rpi-rgb-led-matrix library](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix) by Henner Zeller. For setup, the installation script by Adafruit was used. To run the project, all that needs to be done is to make sure you have the rpi-rgb-led-matrix installed and then run `make`.

## Credits
This led-cube code is based on Staack's [there.oughta.be/an/led-cube github](https://github.com/Staacks/there.oughta.be). This uses the same design and layout, but modifies the functionality of the shader.
